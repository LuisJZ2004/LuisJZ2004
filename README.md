## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I am Luis Eduardo. I'm a Venezuelan Backend developer who has been studying and working with Django framework around 8 months, as well as other skills like HTML and CSS. I started studying programming a few months after the quarentine started in 2020, I learned C++ and Java on my own, a few months later I started studying at Platzi and after nine or ten months I finished the Python/Django career they have (The lenguage and framework I use now). I've been using django (studying and working) for almost one year. Bellow you will find two projects that show a nice part of my knowledge about Python, Django and programming in general. I have expirience working with frontend devs.

My way in programming is just starting yet, I keep learning, reading and studying new skills everyday, as well as sharing my expirience with the rest of the world.
